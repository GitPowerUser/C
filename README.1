.TH laumann 1 "May 2011" "Version 0.1"
.SH NAME
Laumann C Library \- A library of C programs, created for/while learning C by Thomas B. Laumann Jespersen
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B make
[help]
.PP
Use the
.IR Makefile s
found in the different directories to get an idea, of what they are for. The default target for all these directories will be the
.I help
target, printing some sort of useful information.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This "library" is written as an exercise in learning C, mostly using
.B The C Book
, but other resources have also been in use.
.PP
This collection has developed alongside the reading of
.B The C Book
and all of the programs called
.B exampleX_Y
or
.B exerciseX_Y
where
.B X
and
.B Y
are integers, are taken directly from the aforementioned book. A few of these programs don't work, which is because is because they are erroneous in the book (I have checked and double checked).
.PP
Other programs are my own creations, like
.BR redblacktree ,
a red-black tree implementation (which, as of version 0.1 doesn't work properly - I haven't found the error yet),
.B binarytree
(actually a binary search tree) and
.BR write .

.SH LIBRARY OVERVIEW
Here is a list of the directories contained in this library and a short description of them.
.TP
.B begin
To begin at the beginning. This directory has a lot of simple "Getting Started" programs ("Hello, World!" and the like).
.TP
.B cbook
The next step. The exercises I deemed a bit more advanced, or only interesting if you were reading the book.
.TP
.B trigrapher
Take as input a C program and output the same program substituting all characters that can be represented by trigraphs with their trigraph equivalents.
.TP
.B redblacktree
A red-black tree implementation. This implementation is faulty, because printing an in-order traversal of the tree might not yield its elements in a sorted order. The bug (I believe) is found in the rotations, maybe it's a race condition of a kind.
.TP
.B binarytree
A binary search tree implementation.
.TP
.B linkedlist
A (doubly) linked list implementation.
.TP
.B pattern
A pattern matching program. This program is taken from the penultimate section of
.B The C
.BR Book ,
and is a simplistic grep-like program.
